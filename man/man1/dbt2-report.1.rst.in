SYNOPSIS
========

**dbt2-report** [option...] directory

DESCRIPTION
===========

**dbt2-report** is a wrapper script that helps calculates the transactions
rate, and may also be used to generate an HTML report, from test data
collected from using the **dbt2-run** script.

OPTIONS
=======

--html  generate HTML report
--help  This usage message.  Or **-?**.
-V, --version  Output version information, then exit.

NOTES
=====

**dbt-report** executes **dbt2-post-process** to calculate transaction rates
and **dbt2-generate-report** to create the HTML report.  See the help for these
scripts for additional options that are available when run directly.

For example, **dbt2-post-process** has additional controls for reviewing the
driver's random number generator, and **dbt2-generate-report** has additional
controls for selecting a different chart rendering engine.

EXAMPLES
========

Calculate the transaction rates from a **dbt2-run** test saved in the *results*
directory::

    dbt2 report results

Generate a comprehensive HTML report from a **dbt2-run** test saved in the
*results* directory::

    dbt2 report --html results
