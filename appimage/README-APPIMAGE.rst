AppImages are only for Linux based systems:

    https://appimage.org/

The AppImageKit AppImage can be downloaded from:

    https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases

It is recommended to build AppImages on older distributions:

    https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/concepts.html#build-on-old-systems-run-on-newer-systems

At the time of this document, CentOS 7 is the one of the oldest supported Linux
distributions with the oldest libc version.

The logo used is the number "2" from the Freeware Metal On Metal Font.

See separate README-APPIMAGE-* files for specific limitations when using the
building and using the AppImage with a specific database management system.

See the README.rst in the container/ directory for an example of creating an
AppImage with a Podman container.
